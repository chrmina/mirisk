    <P>
      <B>A Natural Disaster can destroy years of Development in a few seconds.</B><BR>
      <B>This is because building design codes are only a minimum level of design.</B><BR>  
      That is, the purpose of normal building design codes is not to
      eliminate all damage given a major earthquake, flood or tropical
      cyclone.  Rather, the code's purpose is to prevent major loss of
      life - significant damage is acceptable per modern building codes,
      if not many people die.<BR>  
      It can be very wise, and cost-effective, for a Development Manager to
      require a moderately enhance level of construction for natural
      hazards for a Project.<BR>
      This is especially true when one considers the total costs of damage,
      in terms of Project loss of use ("business interruption").<BR> 
      MIRISK (Mitigation Information and Risk Identification System) is a
      tool to help Development Managers consider natural hazards risk, and
      ways to reduce that risk, by:
    </P>
    <ul>
      <li><B>identifying</B> natural hazards affecting a region</li>
      <li><B>defining</B> the kinds of infrastructure ("assets") that make up
	typical Development projects</li>
      <li><B>describing</B> the vulnerability of these assets to natural hazards,
	and how vulnerability can be reduced</li>
      <li><B>analyzing</B> the natural hazards and vulnerability data, to assess
	whether Projects should follow normal design practices, or whether
	the cost of some enhanced design for natural hazards is justified by
	the benefits (of avoided losses).</li>
    </ul>
    <P>
      Natural hazards currently considered are earthquakes, flood, tropical
      cyclone, and volcanism.<BR>
      MIRISK's basic purpose is to allow a Development Manager to quickly
      learn if natural hazards are very significant in a region where the
      Manager is considering development.  If so, MIRISK provides
      information on what can be done, and permits estimation of the added
      cost for a moderately enhanced level of construction for natural
      hazards.  An 'optimum' level of enhanced construction is
      estimated, based on the degree of hazard, the type of facility, and
      the Project's benefit cost ratio (BCR, used to account for
      indirect costs of damage).

    <P>
      The first step in risk analysis is to learn if a project component is located in
      a high hazard region (ie, <I>what nature may put there</I>).<BR>  
      When the LOCATION/HAZARD tab is clicked, a map of the world is seen
      (and possibly some components numbers showing the Users previously
      identified component).  Users locate their component by:
    </P>
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking on Zoom In, and draw a box around a region, and so on, to
	zoom into the region of interest.</li>  
      <li>Entering lat/long, or</li> 
      <li>Entering a place name (which is searched for via a built-in
	gazetteer).</li>
    </ul>
    <P> 
      When the region is located, the degree of Earthquake, Wind, Flood or
      Volcano risk for a region can be seen via color codes (click Key tab
      on the bottom to see the degrees of risk, which are explained further
      below, under HAZARD DATA).<BR> 
      The LAYERS tab on the left controls what is visible on the map -
      all Hazards, Components and other information can be turned on or
      off. The map can also be queried to learn the degree of risk at any
      location.

    <P>
      The second step in risk analysis is to define what the component
      consists of, in terms of types of facilities and construction (ie,
      <I>what you are thinking of  putting there</I>).<BR>  
      On the page you define your component by clicking on some menus, and
      MUST input <U>ASSET VALUE DATA</U> (e.g. anticipated component cost, for
      construction and including overhead) and component <U>BENEFIT COST RATIO</U>
      (BCR). The component cost and BCR are used for a benefit-cost
      assessment.  BCR is the estimate of the total component benefit
      (including some monetized estimate of future social benefits), divided
      by the total component cost.<BR>
      To Define the component when the ASSET tab is clicked, you can
      either:
    </P>
    <ul>
      <li>Retrieve an existing component, using the menus on the left, or</li>
      <li>Define a new Asset, using the menus on the right. These menus first
	ask you to define one of three ASSET CATEGORY:
	<ul>
	  <li>Buildings</li>
	  <li>Transportation</li>
	  <li>Utilities / Industry</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>For each of the three Asset Categories, the User then defines a
	CATEGORY CLASS, such as 
	<ul>
	  <li>Buildings
	    <ul>
	      <li>Wood</li>
	      <li>Light Metal</li>
	      <li>Low-rise Reinforced Masonry or Reinforced Concrete, etc</li> 
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Transportation
	    <ul>
	      <li>Bridges, conventional</li>
	      <li>Bridges, Major</li>
	      <li>Tunnels, etc</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Utilities / Industry
	    <ul>
	      <li>Chimneys</li> 
	      <li>Cranes</li>
	      <li>Conveyor systems etc</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <P>    
      When the Category Class (e.g. Low Rise Reinforced Masonry or
      Reinforced Concrete) is selected, the DESCRIPTION, DAMAGE AND DESIGN
      INFORMATION ON ASSETS pane changes, to provide photographs and a
      description of the class, its Vulnerability to various hazards and how
      to reduce (mitigate) the vulnerability. By reading these descriptions,
      a Development Manager can quickly gain some familiarity with what
      these various Classes are, how they are damaged by natural hazards
      and, in general, what are some of the techniques used to reduce their
      vulnerability to natural hazards.  This information provides a good
      background for users not expert in natural hazards mitigation.

    <P>
      This MIRISK tab summarizes the input information, and uses it to
      estimate:
    </P>
    <ul>
      <li>potential losses due to a natural hazard for the identified site and</li> 
      <li>the cost of enhanced design for that hazard, to identify if enhanced
	design may be warranted, given the regional hazards for the project
	location and the value of the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <P>
      The page can be printed out (hard copy or pdf) as a report for your
      project, using the icons on the upper right.<BR><BR> 
      The Results are provided for the various hazards, and consist of the
      expected cost of construction for minimum code, and for some
      moderately enhanced level of construction (for natural hazards).  The
      enhanced level is shown as a factor (eg, 1.02) which represents
      designing the component (asset) for "2%" more than the minimum code
      requirement for the component for that site.  Enhancing the level of
      construction increases the cost of construction, and an estimate of
      that increased cost is shown in the table on this tab.<BR><BR>  
      When a natural hazard occurs, such as an earthquake or tropical
      cyclone, damage is likely to occur, especially if the component was
      designed only per the minimum building code requirements. <B>This is
	because the purpose of normal building design codes is not to
	eliminate all damage given a major earthquake, flood or tropical
	cyclone.</B> Rather, the code's purpose is to prevent major loss of
      life - significant damage is acceptable per modern building codes,
      if not many people die.<BR><BR>
      Therefore, the cost of damage and associated losses are estimated for
      minimal code level design.  The technical details of this estimation
      are discussed further below, but basically the MIRISK estimates the
      cost of damage from a database of such costs for various hazards and
      types of facilities. It includes in this loss estimate not only the
      direct cost of repairs to the facility, but also the associated costs
      of loss of use of the facility (eg, renting another facility while the
      first is repaired).  These associated costs are estimated using the
      BCR input by the User.<BR><BR>
      In return for the increased expenditure for natural hazards, the
      enhanced level of construction should have less damage when a natural
      hazard occurs.  Therefore, the cost of damage and associated losses
      are estimated for not only for minimal code level design, but also for
      each level of design, from 1.0 (minimum code requirement) to 1.4 (40%
      greater than minimum code).  These are tabulated in the Results
      Table.<BR><BR>
      Lastly, the Total Cost of the component, which is the sum of the cost of
      construction (increasing with enhanced level of design) plus the cost
      of damage and associated losses (decreasing with enhanced level of
      design), are tabulated.<BR><BR>  
      <B>The minimum Total Cost is the 'optimum' enhanced level of
	construction design for the component.</B><BR><BR>
      The results are presented in tabular form, and graphically, for each
      hazard.

    <P>
      <B><U>LOCATION:</U></B> Location is specified in MIRISK in one of three ways:
      by specifying a lat/long, by inputting a geographic place name, or
      by zooming in on the global composite photograph and clicking on a
      point.  Of the three methods, zooming and clicking is by far the
      easiest, and more accurate than specifying a place name.  If
      accurate lat/long data are available for the site of interest,
      this should be employed. The place name gazetteer currently
      employed in MIRISK is rather limited, with only about 2,000 place
      names.  Much larger gazetteers are available, and an 80,000 place
      name data set was initially tried in MIRISK, but this dataset
      proved problematic.  In the future, a more extensive gazetteer
      should be employed in MIRISK, although any international gazetteer
      will always have orthographic issues.
      <BR><BR> 
      <B><U>HAZARD:</U></B> The HAZARD data used in MIRISK version 1.0 are derived from
      the Global Hotspots* data set, which itself is a compilation of
      other datasets on a 2 by 2 degree lat/long grid.  As noted in the
      Hotspots report: "<I>...globally uniform data do not yet exist to
	produce a justifiable measure of hazard severity that can be
	applied consistently across multiple hazards.</I>"  That is, both
      the Hotspots project and MIRISK have had to make assumptions at
      several stages, in order to permit any analysis at all to be
      performed.  Best professional judgment was used, and the results
      are believed to be approximately correct, although significant
      improvements are possible with further work. Specific Hotspots
      data employed in MIRISK are:
    </P>
    <ul>
      <li><B>Earthquake:</B>  The Hotspots report used the GSHAP** map, and
	averaged GSHAP seismic hazard data over 2 by 2 degree lat/long
	grid.  In the process, substantial hazard data was lost, as the
	GSHAP data is much more detailed. GSHAP data are peak ground
	accelerations corresponding to a 0.0021 annual probability of
	exceedance.   Thus, seismic hazard data in MIRISK are peak ground
	accelerations corresponding to a 0.0021 annual probability of
	exceedance, averaged over a 2 by 2 degree lat/long grid.</li>
      <li><B>Tropical Cyclone:</B> The Hotspots treatment of tropical cyclone data
	is summarized in Appendix A.1 of the Hotspots report, and appears
	to be a decile ranking of frequencies of tropical cyclone
	occurrence within a grid cell, based on the 1981-2000 data set.
	For MIRISK, this decile ranking was assumed equivalent to a range
	from 120 kph to 300 kph wind speeds, with corresponding annual
	probability of exceedance of 0.01.</li>
      <li><B>Flood:</B> Hotspots used a global compilation of flooding for the
	period 1985-2003, developed by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory.
	The resulting dataset appears to be a decile ranking of flood
	occurrence within a grid cell. For MIRISK, this decile ranking was
	assumed equivalent to a flood depth of 0 to 3.0 m, with
	corresponding annual probability of exceedance of 0.01.</li>
      <li><B>Volcano:</B> Volcano locations are currently depicted in MIRISK, but
	no analytical capability is provided. This is an area for future
	enhancement.</li>

      The taxonomy and associated vulnerability data (discussed below) are
      based on the ATC-13 data set*.  The ATC-13 data set were developed
      specific to California construction.  For MIRISK, some adjustments
      were made since most MIRISK applications will be in developing
      countries, although it should be noted that most MIRISK applications
      will be for <U>new construction</U> per modern building codes per typical
      World Bank practice.   That is, MIRISK applications are not for
      existing construction, which may be of much poorer quality than that
      built under Bank funding. Nevertheless, additional work for more
      accurate vulnerability data is an area for potential MIRISK
      improvement.

    <P>
      The Analysis methodology follows a standard benefit-cost framework, in
      which normal code design is taken as a given baseline.   Normal
      building codes are written to assure life safety, and not to minimize
      property damage, so that significant property damage is likely to be
      sustained by even new construction designed per modern building codes,
      when subjected to higher intensity natural hazards.  This is
      well-known*, and has led to the recent emergence of performance-based
      design in the structural engineering field**.  Consequently, there is
      a substantial risk of economic loss given normal building code
      design.  This loss is not only direct property loss (ie, cost of
      repair) but also the attendant loss of use and associated expenses
      (so-called indirect loss).
      <BR><BR>
      Direct loss is accounted for by using the vulnerability functions of
      ATC-13 for the specific Category class, and the hazard as determined
      for the site from the Hotspots data (including the assumptions as
      discussed above).  The hazard is however only a point estimate, and
      the entire hazard curve is calculated based on the assumption that the
      hazard frequency follows the Ishimoto-Iida law (ie, log-log relation)
      with a slope of 1.0.
      <BR><BR>
      Indirect loss is accounted for by multiplying the direct loss by the
      Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) for the Component, as input by the User.
      Bank project BCRs vary from 1 to as much as 10, with an average value
      being about 6.0.
      <BR><BR>
      The expected annual loss (EAL) for the Component is then calculated by
      numerical integration of the vulnerability and hazard functions, over
      all values of hazard.  The present value of all future losses is then
      calculated as the EAL divided by the real interest rate (this assumes
      an infinite economic life, which slightly overestimates the present
      value, but is not a bad assumption in general).  Real interest rates
      vary, but an average value of 0.03 per annum is a reasonable value in
      many cases.
      <BR><BR>
      The above algorithm can be applied for normal code design (denoted as
      DLF, or Design Level Factor, 1.0), or for any enhanced design.  If the
      normal code requirement for a natural hazard is increased by 10% (eg,
      earthquake design is for 0.22g, rather than for 0.20g, lateral force),
      this is denoted as a DLF=1.10.  If a Component is designed for a
      DLF=1.1, damage due to natural hazards will be significantly
      decreased, with only a marginally higher capital investment for the
      increased design. As DLF increases, damage drops sharply at first, and
      then diminishingly less, while capital investment is very modest at
      first, and then increases rapidly.  For any given DLF, the sum of the
      present value of all future damages, and the increase in capital
      investment, is the Total Cost above normal building code design. The
      curve of Total Cost as a function of DLF has a typical U shape, where
      the minimum Total Cost is the optimum DLF.
      <BR><BR>
      MIRISK calculates the present value of all future damages, the
      increase in capital investment, the Total Cost above normal building
      code design, and presents these results in summary form for
      earthquake, tropical cyclone and flood, and in a detailed tabulation
      (with the optimum DLF highlighted in yellow),  and graph.  If any
      hazard is particularly low, the results are not presented, but simply
      it is noted that that particular hazard is 'not applicable'.
      <BR><BR>  
      The optimum DLF is what makes economic sense. While the MIRISK data
      and methods are only preliminary, they provide guidance as to what
      hazards exist for a site, what the natural hazards performance is
      likely to be for the Component to be constructed, what is an optimum
      DLF for the situation, what should be budgeted by the Bank to achieve
      an economic optimum performance considering natural hazards, and what
      the savings are given this policy.
