  <h3>ABOUT</h3>
  <P>During the 1990s, the cumulative loss of economic assets due to
  natural disasters is estimated at 2.5% of 2000 GDP for China, 5.2%
  for Bangladesh, and 15.6% for Nicaragua. This loss includes network
  infrastructure (e.g., bridges, power transmission lines, pipelines,
  etc.) not engineered to withstand the impacts of earthquakes and
  floods. Most visibly, building infrastructure is vulnerable. The two
  major earthquakes in Turkey in 1999 damaged some 23,400
  buildings. Some 16,400 of these, encompassing 93,000 housing units
  and 15,000 small business units, collapsed or were heavily
  damaged. The World Bank has contributed significantly to disaster
  recovery efforts across the developing world including nearly a
  billion dollars for Asian tsunami recovery, reconstruction following
  the Gujarat earthquake in India ($443m), Hurricane Mitch
  reconstruction in Honduras ($200m), Marmara earthquake
  reconstruction in Turkey ($505m), and flood recovery in Mozambique
  ($30m).<BR><BR>
  The Bank is increasingly integrating natural hazard risk management
  and mitigation approaches into the design of infrastructure projects
  as well as in policy advice to clients to ensure that new
  infrastructure is able to withstand disaster impacts. Mitigation
  Information and Risk Identification System (<B>MIRISK</B>) is one such tool
  developed by the World Bank which will provide sources of information
  for natural hazards design guidelines, norms and good practices, and
  is intended for use by Development Managers during all stages of the
  Project Cycle. <B>MIRISK</B> has been developed to let users identify the
  natural hazards related to the development project, identify the
  typical vulnerability of each infrastructure, identify normal design
  and mitigation plan of each infrastructure.<BR><BR>
  With assistance from Government of Japan under Japan CTF, <B>MIRISK</B> was
  developed by the MIRISK Team at Kyoto University (Christakis Mina, Takahiro
  Tsutsumiuchi), under the direction of Prof. Charles Scawthorn and
  the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
  (Saroj K. Jha, Program Manager).</P>
