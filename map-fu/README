INTERFACE FEATURES

A. USER WIDGETS

- Typical zoom in, zoom out, pan and scale tools

- Zoom to tool, allowing one to specify a specific map scale or
  constrain by lat/lon 

- Zoom to scale tool that uses a set of predefined scale values.  The
  user can choose a map scale using a selector or zoom in or out from one
  predefined scale to the next.  The default scale selector is a drop-down
  menu but can be customized to use other types of selectors such as a
  slider bar.

- Reference map tab for visualizing the current map view in relation
  to the full map.

- MapInfo tab providing map metadata.

- Scrollable error tab for viewing current and past errors.

B. DEVELOPER FEATURES - PHP

- Abstract Component class providing a common interface for defining
  Tools, Banners, Datasources, etc.  Allows much of the Javascript,
  CSS and HTML for each component to be defined server-side in one
  place, then collated for client side use.

- DefaultDataSource class used to provide and manage any datasource that
  the mapping application may need, specifically a list of available
  mapfiles and the logic to allow the user to choose between them.

- JSON class for serializing and transmitting objects from
  server to client.

C. DEVELOPER FEATURES - Javascript

- Map object for handling map related queries and functionality.

- MapState object which provides information client-side about the
  maps current state.

- Queue object for making AJAX calls and ensuring they are done
  in-order.

- TabMenu and Tab objects for creating custom quick-access tab menus
  allowing other widgets to be tucked away in the interface taking up
  minimal real estate

- Panel object for creating a set of stackable panels that contain other
  functionality.  Tabs are used to switch between them.

- Scrollable debug tab for displaying info while debugging
