Map-Fu - RELEASE
----------------

Current Release:

0.14 - Apr. 17 2007

Changes

  - Sample data is now provided by default

  - Google geocoder abstraction is included.  See SETUP for details on
    how to use it.  ZoomTo tool makes use of it out of the box.

  - Panning works much better, the map image drags with your cursor

  - Legends are built in.  Look at SampleDatasource.php for how its
    being created/updated.  The legend is created in map.php using a
    mapserver template which is under templates/legend.html.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.13 - Dec. 8th 2006

Changes:

 - New print tool for displaying the current map image in a popup for
   printing.

 - Converged all general configuration files into one.

 - The general configuration file and Datasource configuration file
   are now templates, to be copied and setup by each user of map-fu to
   fit their environment.

 - New scheme is used for finding the base map-fu directory from any
   subdirectory since PHP doesn't provide a way to do this.  Each
   subdirectory may now have a .root_config.php file containing the
   variable $ROOT which defines the relative path to the base
   directory.

 - Moved most php files floating around in includes/ into
   includes/php.  $php_path is now defined in config.

 - svn:keywords has been setup in most files.  Any new files added to
   the repository should have them.  This can be setup to be done
   automatically.

Bug Fixes:

 - Fixed rounding issue for data in decimal degree, see 1607285

0.12 Alpha - Nov. 6th 2006

Changes since release:

Features:

- Created ScaleZoomMenu selector providing a drop-down menu for
  zooming to a specific map extent.  Used by the ScaleZoom tool.

Code Changes:

- Updated ScaleZoom Tool defining the zoom selector externally.

- Added afterMapUpdate method to Component class allowing components
  defined server side to be updated after each map update.

- To make the afterMapUpdate method possible, the JS Map object,
  formerly defined in map.js, is now generated server-side and
  inserted as inline JS.

- JS code responsible for creating and managing the map is now
  generated server-side and inserted inline (formerly map.js).  This
  allows interaction with JS objects generated server-side to be
  defined server-side.  For example,

- Map image is now displayed within an IMG tag instead of making it
  the background image for the map container.  This increases the
  number of JS events available.  This was not done before because
  drag events allowed by the IMG tag were conflicting with the box
  drawing functionality (rubber band).  A second transparent container
  is now placed over the image and handles the box drawing.
